# HR-ANALYTICS--DASHBOARD

The HR Analytics Dashboard project has successfully developed reports and a dashboard that display important HR metrics. The dashboard includes employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, active employee count, department-wise attrition, education field-wise attrition, average employee age, gender-wise attrition, different age-wise gender distribution, and department and job role-wise satisfaction. This comprehensive collection of metrics provides valuable insights into the organization's workforce composition, attrition patterns, and employee satisfaction across various dimensions.

The project's objective is to create a user-friendly dashboard that presents these metrics in a visually appealing and intuitive manner. Users will be able to navigate through the dashboard, filter data based on specific criteria (such as department or gender), and gain insights into attrition trends and factors impacting employee satisfaction. By consolidating and visualizing these metrics, the HR Analytics Dashboard will empower HR professionals to make data-driven decisions and implement targeted strategies to improve employee retention and satisfaction
